# mondrian-rest [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jazzido/mondrian-rest.svg?branch=public)](https://travis-ci.org/jazzido/mondrian-rest) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/jazzido/mondrian-rest/badge.svg?branch=public)](https://coveralls.io/github/jazzido/mondrian-rest?branch=public)

A REST endpoint for [Mondrian](http://community.pentaho.com/projects/mondrian/)

## Usage

See [`mondrian-rest-demo`](https://github.com/jazzido/mondrian-rest-demo) and [`mondrian-rest-foodmart`](https://github.com/jazzido/mondrian-rest-foodmart) for example OLAP cubes implemented with `mondrian-rest`.

[`mondrian-rest-ui`](https://github.com/jazzido/mondrian-rest-ui) is an experimental visualization tool for `mondrian-rest`, inspired by [CubesViewer](https://github.com/jjmontesl/cubesviewer) and [Polestar](https://github.com/vega/polestar).

*NOTE*: `mondrian-rest` expect the `mondrian.olap.SsasCompatibleNaming` Java property is set to `true`. Set a environment variable `JAVA_OPTS="-Dmondrian.olap.SsasCompatibleNaming=true"` to the process that uses `mondrian-rest`.

## In the wild

`mondrian-rest` powers [Datachile](https://es.datachile.io)'s, [DataUSA](https://datausa.io), and other fine websites built by [Datawheel](http://datawheel.us).

## Credits

Initial inspiration for this project came from [Stefan Urbanek](https://github.com/Stiivi)'s [`cubes`](http://cubes.databrewery.org/) OLAP server. `mondrian-rest` uses [Raimonds Simanovskis](https://github.com/rsim)'s fantastic [`mondrian-olap`](https://github.com/rsim/mondrian-olap) library.

Development of this project has been generously sponsored by [Datawheel](http://datawheel.us).
